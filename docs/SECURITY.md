## Reporting a vulnerability

### How to report

If you found a vulnerability in our software, please contact our security
response team by email at `secalert at scality dot com`. Only the security
response team members will see your email address. We are committed to process
emails sent confidentially.

### When to report to the mailing list

Depending on the level of risk related to the issue, the security response team
mailing list might not be the most appropriate channel to report it.

### Sending patches

Contributions are not necessary to report a vulnerability. However, if you wish
to send patches, please do so using a confidential communication channel, such
as the security response team mailing list, or another negotiated channel.

### Credits for your work

We are committed to credit your work when publicly disclosing the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability disclosure

Disclaimer: our software comes with absolutely not warranty to non Scality
customer.

For critical security vulnerabilities, our customers will be notified before the
vulnerability will be publicly disclosed by Scality.

Scality does not commit to any schedule regarding the public disclosure of their
security vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, we will try our best to deal with
vulnerability public disclosure responsibly in order to maintain a healthy open
source community.
