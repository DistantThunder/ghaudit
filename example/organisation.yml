# This is an example of ghaudit main configuration.

# This configuration file describes the expected structure or the organisation
# members and teams hierarchy.

# tip: YAML anchors can be used to define redundant information. Depending on
# the configuration, this could be useful for defining a common email, a list of
# common members, or even a list of common children teams. This is entirely
# optional.

  teams:
    # In github teams can be organised in hierarchies. A team can have zero or
    # more child team, and a team can have zero or more parents. Teams can be
    # defined without any particular order, but when a child is referenced from
    # a team, it must exist.
